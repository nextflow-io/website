<h3>Google Summer of Code 2016</h3>
</div>

The Comparative Bioinformatics lab, ([CRG, Barcelona, Spain](http://www.crg.es)) is inviting
students to apply for the Google Summer of Code 2016. The CRG is a world leader
in genomics and develops high visibility bioinformatics software such as [T-Coffee](http://www.tcoffee.org).

This year, we are proposing [three projects](http://obf.github.io/GSoC/ideas/#nextflow)
based on Nextflow, an increasingly popular workflow framework developed by our lab and
especially well suited for bioinformatics analysis.
Students are also welcome to propose a project of their own.

While the work will be mostly carried out online, limited funds will be available to
organize a visit in Barcelona at the Center for Genomics Regulation.

Qualified applicants must be at least 18 years of age and enrolled in an accredited academic
institution (see the GSoC for more information). Selected students will work on their projects
from May to August and receive a $5'500 in compensation.

Students are highly encouraged to contact us prior to their application. Official registration
is open from March the 14th 2016 until March the 25th and must be submitted online via the
[GSoC Website](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). Our lab will participate under
the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://www.open-bio.org) umbrella.
