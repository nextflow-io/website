## Nextflow at the heart of UK genomics

### Vladimir Kiselev
*Head of Cellular Genetics Informatics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK* 

The [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) is one of the biggest genomics centres in the world. To accommodate its compute needs it has ~10'000 cores on our LSF compute farm and ~12'000 cores on our OpenStack cloud environment. The Cellular Genetics programme is one of five of the Institute's programmes and investigates cell biology and human disease by focusing on cell types implicated in these processes. We utilise Nextflow to run our pipelines on both LSF and OpenStack environments. In my talk I will present our recent experiences and will concentrate on Kubernetes integration in Nextflow.

### Bio 

[Vladimir](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/vladimir-yu-kiselev) graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 2008 with a degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics. He then changed direction and did a PhD in Computational Biology at the University of Edinburgh. From 2011 he worked on multiple Bioinformatics projects at the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Babraham Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. In 2018 he became the Head of the core IT team at the Cellular Genetics programme of the Sanger Institute.
