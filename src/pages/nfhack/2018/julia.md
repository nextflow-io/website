## Exploiting orthology and de novo transcriptome assembly to refine target sequence information

### Julia Soellner
*PhD student, Boehringer Ingelheim & University Tuebingen, Germany*

The ability to generate recombinant proteins facilitates several steps in drug discovery research, e.g. investigating drug-target-interactions or assessing a compound’s efficacy and safety. For this, the target’s exact protein sequence is required. Public databases such as Ensembl, UniProt and RefSeq are an important source of sequence information. However, many sequences for non-human organisms are predicted by computational pipelines and may thus be incomplete or contain errors. We present a Nextflow pipeline which exploits paired-end RNA-Seq reads for sequence validation and refinement by making use of sequence homology relationships across different species. We applied the pipeline to refine and validate the orthologues of all known human protein sequences in six species.

### Bio

Julia is a bioinformatician by training and she is currently in the second year of my PhD. Her PhD project is conducted at Boehringer Ingelheim under the supervision of Prof. Kay Nieselt at University Tuebingen.
