## QCloud: A web-based quality control system for mass spectrometry-based proteomics laboratories

### Roger Olivella
*Proteomics Unit, Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Spain*

[QCloud](https://qcloud.crg.eu) is a web-based system to support proteomics laboratories in daily quality assessment using a user-friendly interface, easy setup, automated data processing and archiving, and unbiased instrument evaluation. QCloud supports the most common targeted and untargeted proteomics workflows, it accepts data formats from different vendors and it enables a user-selected vocabulary to report incidences and annotate the acquired data.
