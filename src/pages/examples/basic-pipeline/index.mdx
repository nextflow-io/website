<h2>Basic pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example shows how to write a pipeline with two simple Bash processes, so that the results
  produced by the first process are consumed by the second process.

<Code
  code={pipelineCode}
  lang="nextflow"
  title="main.nf"
  frame="code"
  mark={[1, 3, {range: "8-19"}, {range: "24-35"}, {range: "40-44"}]}
/>

<Code
  lang="bash"
  title="Running the pipeline"
  frame="terminal"
  code={`nextflow run main.nf

### Key Concepts

This example demonstrates fundamental Nextflow concepts:

- **Pipeline Parameters**: Use `params.in` to make your pipeline configurable from the command line
- **Process Definitions**: Two processes that transform data sequentially - `splitSequences` splits a FASTA file, and `reverse` reverses each sequence
- **Dataflow Programming**: Output from one process automatically becomes input to the next using the `|` operator
- **Parallel Execution**: Each split file is processed independently by the `reverse` process

### Running the Example

```bash
# Use default input file
nextflow run main.nf

# Override input file
nextflow run main.nf --in /path/to/your/sequences.fa
```

The pipeline will split your FASTA file into individual sequences, reverse each one, and print the results.
