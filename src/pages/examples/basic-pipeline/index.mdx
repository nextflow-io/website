<h2>Basic pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example shows how to write a pipeline with two simple Bash processes, so that the results
  produced by the first process are consumed by the second process.
</p>

<Code
  code={pipelineCode}
  lang="nextflow"
  title="main.nf"
  frame="code"
  mark={[1, 3, { range: "8-19" }, { range: "24-35" }, { range: "40-44" }]}
/>

### Key Concepts

This example demonstrates fundamental Nextflow concepts:

- **Pipeline Parameters**: Use `params.in` to make your pipeline configurable from the command line
- **Process Definitions**: Two processes that transform data sequentially - `splitSequences` splits a FASTA file, and `reverse` reverses each sequence
- **Dataflow Programming**: Output from one process automatically becomes input to the next using the `|` operator
- **Parallel Execution**: Each split file is processed independently by the `reverse` process

<Code lang="ansi" title="Running the Example" frame="terminal" code={terminalOutput} />

The pipeline will split your FASTA file into individual sequences, reverse each one, and print the results.
