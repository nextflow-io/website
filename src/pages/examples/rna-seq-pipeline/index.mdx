<h2>RNA-Seq pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example shows the actual RNA-Seq pipeline from the nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf repository. It demonstrates a complete
  RNA-seq analysis workflow including indexing, quality control, quantification, and report generation.

### Key Concepts

This production RNA-seq pipeline demonstrates advanced Nextflow patterns:

- **Real Production Pipeline**: Fetched directly from the official nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf repository
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: Complete RNA-seq analysis from raw reads to final reports
- **Modern Tools Integration**: Uses Salmon for quantification, FastQC for QC, and MultiQC for aggregated reporting
- **Parameter Validation**: Robust input validation and help documentation
- **Resource Optimization**: Proper CPU and memory allocation for each process
- **Container Support**: Full Docker/Singularity container integration
- **Output Organization**: Structured result publishing with meaningful directory names

### Try it on your computer

<Code
  lang="ansi"

**NOTE**: This pipeline automatically downloads from GitHub and includes all necessary tools via containers. Run with `-with-docker` for the complete containerized experience.
