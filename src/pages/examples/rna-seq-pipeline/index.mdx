<h2>RNA-Seq pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example shows how to put together a basic RNA-Seq pipeline. It maps a collection of read-pairs to a given
  reference genome and outputs the respective transcript model.

<Code code={pipelineCode} lang="nextflow" />

### Try it in your computer

To run this pipeline on your computer, you will need:

- Unix-like operating system
- Java 17 (or higher)
- Docker

Install Nextflow by entering the following command in the terminal:

    $ curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

Then launch the pipeline with this command:

    $ nextflow run rnaseq-nf -with-docker

It will automatically download the pipeline [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf) and the associated Docker images, thus the first execution may take a few minutes to complete depending on your network connection.

**NOTE**: To run this example with versions of Nextflow older than 22.04.0, you must include the `-dsl2` flag with `nextflow run`.
