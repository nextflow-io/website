<h2>BLAST pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example splits a FASTA file into chunks and executes a BLAST query for each chunk in parallel. Then, all the
  sequences for the top hits are collected and merged into a single result file.

### Try it on your computer

To run this pipeline on your computer, you will need:

- Unix-like operating system
- Java 17 (or higher)
- Docker

Install Nextflow by entering the following command in the terminal:

    $ curl -fsSL https://get.nextflow.io | bash

Then launch the pipeline with this command:

    $ ./nextflow run blast-example -with-docker

It will automatically download the pipeline [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/blast-example) and the associated Docker images, thus the first execution may take a few minutes to complete depending on your network connection.

**NOTE**: To run this example with versions of Nextflow older than 22.04.0, you must include the `-dsl2` flag with `nextflow run`.
