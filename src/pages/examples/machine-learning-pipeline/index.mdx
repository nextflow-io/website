<h2>Machine Learning pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example shows how to put together a basic Machine Learning pipeline. It fetches a dataset from OpenML, trains a
  variety of machine learning models on a prediction target, and selects the best model based on some evaluation
  criteria.

<Code code={pipelineCode} lang="nextflow" />

### Try it in your computer

To run this pipeline on your computer, you will need:

- Unix-like operating system
- Java 17 (or higher)
- Docker

Install Nextflow by entering the following command in the terminal:

    $ curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

Then launch the pipeline with this command:

    $ nextflow run ml-hyperopt -profile wave

It will automatically download the pipeline [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/ml-hyperopt) and build a Docker image on-the-fly using [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/), thus the first execution may take a few minutes to complete depending on your network connection.

**NOTE**: Nextflow 22.10.0 or newer is required to run this pipeline with Wave.
