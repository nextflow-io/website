<h2>Machine Learning pipeline</h2>

<p class="">
  This example demonstrates a complete Machine Learning workflow using Nextflow. It splits a dataset, trains multiple
  models in parallel (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression), and evaluates their performance to find the best model.

### Key Concepts

This example demonstrates advanced Machine Learning patterns with Nextflow:

- **Parallel Model Training**: Train multiple ML models simultaneously using the `each` operator
- **Python Integration**: Embed scikit-learn scripts directly in Nextflow processes
- **Data Splitting**: Automatically split datasets into training and testing subsets
- **Model Serialization**: Save trained models using pickle for evaluation
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare multiple models to find the best performing one
- **Reproducible ML**: Use fixed random seeds for consistent results across runs

### Try it on your computer

<Code
  lang="ansi"

**NOTE**: This pipeline requires Python with pandas and scikit-learn. The example demonstrates ML workflow patterns and parallel model training capabilities.
