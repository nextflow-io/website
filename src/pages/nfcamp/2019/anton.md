## NF-web: a web interface for Nextflow

### Anton Khodak
*Senior Software Developer, Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK*

We are presenting an open-source web application for running Nextflow pipelines on OpenStack. It lets users with no Nextflow experience start pipelines by uploading data and filling in input parameters, be notified once the analysis is finished and get the results uploaded to S3.  Although it was created for the OpenStack use-case, it allows plugging in a different backend for other cloud providers, such as GCE or AWS. Advanced users can pass Nextflow options along with the pipeline inputs. The pipeline collection is easily extended, nf-core pipelines can be added by submitting YAML manifests to the service. In the talk, we will demonstrate how launching this service gives scientists at Cellular Genetics department of Wellcome Sanger Institute who have no Nextflow experience an ability to run pipelines themselves and makes Nextflow adoption easier across the whole institute.
