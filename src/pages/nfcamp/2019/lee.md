## Governance & Guardrails: Managing your AWS account to ensure your data is secure and your budget is safe

### Lee Pang
*Genomics Specialist, Amazon Web Services, USA*

The most common questions asked by new AWS customers involve finding the tools and learning the techniques to ensure that resources and data are secure and costs are under control. Regardless of where you put your data (on-prem or in the cloud) data breaches must be prevented. Similarly, no one wants a surprise bill for resources that they didn't remember were running. In this talk we will introduce you to the tools & techniques that let you create the guardrails for your AWS account - making sure that you have the best perimeter security, strong encryption, and budget-monitoring alarms to maintain control over cost, compliance, and operational efficiency.
