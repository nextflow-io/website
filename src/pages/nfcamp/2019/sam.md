## Accelerating Bioinformatics with Nextflow and the Cloud

### Sam Minot
*Research Scientist, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, USA*

Biologists tend to approach computational analysis in an extremely practical way — coding just enough to answer the question at hand, and knowing that our questions are constantly changing. With that mindset it can be difficult to justify adopting any technology platform which offers increased capabilities in exchange for rigidity or lock-in. In my own research activities I have found that Nextflow offers a very attractive bargain, lots of functionality with very little lock-in. In this talk I will share my own experience moving my microbiome research, which involves computationally microbial metagenomic analysis, into Nextflow, including our approach to cloud computing and the process of rolling out a new technology platform to a large community of researchers across my institution.

### Bio

Sam Minot works as a Staff Scientist at Fred Hutch within the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division focusing on gene-level metagenomics and biomedical research. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 2008 and received his Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology in 2012 from the University of Pennsylvania. He's a big fan of culinary microbiology but tries not to talk about the gut microbiome at dinner parties.
