## Migrating legacy workflows to Nextflow

### Alexander Peltzer
*Bioinformatics Research Scientist, Quantitative Biology Center Tübingen, Germany* 

Many researchers and institutions face similar issues: Having in-house legacy workflows written in bash or other formats and now facing issues with reproducibility, maintenance of these pipelines and the increasing computational demands poses severe threats to being able to address modern computational questions using such legacy workflows. In this talk, I intend to highlight the efforts we took at the QBIC to maintain compatibility between existing workflows but simultaneously porting all of our existing legacy pipelines to the Nextflow and nf-core frameworks to be able to answer these threats. With a specific application case on one of the most widely used ancient DNA pipelines, I intend to highlight the benefits of these migrated pipeline in comparison to the previously existing workflow in a 1:1 setting.

### Bio

Alexander Peltzer is a bioinformatics research scientist at the Quantitative Biology Center in Tübingen and is working in maintaining and developing modern solutions for data management and analysis for various omics technologies there. Before, he obtained a PhD in bioinformatics at the University of Tübingen  and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History where he worked on computational methods for ancient DNA reconstruction.
