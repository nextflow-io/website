## Nextflow and human microbiome: from data to insights

### Francesco Strozzi
*Head of Data Science, Enterome Bioscience, France*

Using Nextflow at scale gives the possibility to extensively analyse complex datasets such as the human gut microbiome, and investigate microbial composition both at the taxonomical and functional level. This is a fundamental step towards a broader and deeper comprehension of the role the human microbiome has in diseases progression, prevention and treatment. Key examples will be presented to highlight the impact and the contribution Nextflow is providing in this field.

### Bio

Head of Data Science, leading a team of bioinformaticians and biostatisticians focused on quantitative and functional human microbiome analysis for drugs development and biomarkers discovery.
