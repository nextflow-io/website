          <h2 class="h3 mb-6">Why become a Nextflow Ambassador?</h2>

          <p>
            The Nextflow ambassador program is a unique and exciting initiative designed to empower passionate
            individuals within the Nextflow community to play a more active role in fostering collaboration, knowledge
            sharing, and engagement. As a Nextflow Ambassador, you will have the opportunity to amplify the reach and
            impact of Nextflow by promoting its adoption, organizing community events, sharing your expertise through
            presentations and tutorials, and assisting fellow community members with their questions and challenges.
            This program is a way to recognise the dedicated volunteers that contribute their time, enthusiasm, and
            expertise to help grow and strengthen the Nextflow ecosystem. By becoming a Nextflow Ambassador, you'll not
            only enhance your own skills and network but also contribute to the advancement of scientific research and
            data analysis on a global scale.

          <h2 class="h3 mb-6">What we expect from you</h2>

          <p>
            Examples of activities for an ambassador could include talking about Nextflow and nf-core at local events,
            writing or sharing tweets or blog posts about Nextflow and nf-core, or managing local user groups for
            organizing workshops and hackathons. Of course, if you have other ideas of how to promote Nextflow and
            nf-core we encourage you to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
            Successful ambassadors are individuals recognized for their expertise and willingness to help others learn
            about the framework and community. They are interested in and may already help coordinate local and regional
            meetups, create educational content such as blog posts, whitepapers, case studies, or training.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ambassador program exists to empower community members with tools and resources. Your responsibilities
            could include:

            We do our best to monitor the activities of our ambassadors (with your help) and review membership twice per
            year. The quantity and types of contributions vary between ambassadors and we understand that other demands
            can fluctuate over time - membership of the program is non-binding.
