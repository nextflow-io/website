In this episode of the Channels podcast, it’s all about developer experience! 👩🏻‍💻🎉

[Ben Sherman](https://github.com/bentsherman) takes [Phil Ewels](https://twitter.com/tallphil) through new and upcoming language improvements in the Nextflow language which will help people writing Nextflow pipelines write code faster, with fewer errors, and of course with beautifully formatted indentation 🤩

<!-- end-archive-description -->

We cover:

- What exactly was happening in the last episode, when Marcel, Chris and Phil ran wild with a beta version of breakpoint debugging in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Why informative error messages are difficult in Nextflow, and how we’re making things better (coming to your console in the next stable release!)
- How we’re building a Nextflow language server, for linting, formatting and code completion in your favourite IDE.

We mentioned an issue / PR label used on the Nextflow GitHub repo called `error-improvements` - [check those out here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues?q=label%3Aerror-improvements)!
