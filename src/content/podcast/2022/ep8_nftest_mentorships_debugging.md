#### nf-test

- [nf-test](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test) is a simple test framework for Nextflow pipelines.
  - Developed by [Lukas Forer](https://twitter.com/lukfor), [Sebastian Sch√∂nher](https://twitter.com/seppinho), and [others](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/graphs/contributors).
- nf-test has a range of functions that can be used to test a pipeline to ensure it is being run correctly.
  - Documentation can be found [here](https://code.askimed.com/nf-test/).
- [Edmund Miller](https://github.com/Emiller88) recently presented a [ByteSize](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize_nftest) talk discussing nf-test.
- nf-test is being incorporated into some nf-core pipelines and will likely be incorporated into all nf-core pipelines in the future.

#### Nextflow and nf-core mentorship program

- Nextflow and nf-core runs a [mentorship program](https://nf-co.re/mentorships) that is supported by our [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) grant.
- Round 1 of the program was a great success.
  - Check out the [blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2022/czi-mentorship-round-1.html) to see what our mentor/mentee paris did.
- Round 2 of the mentorship program started in December 2022 and will finish in March 2023.
- Participation jumped from 5 pairs last round to 13 pairs made up of mentors and mentees from around the globe.
- Keep an eye out for updates and the next round starting in the middle of next year.

#### Debugging resume

- [Abhinav Sharma](https://twitter.com/abhi18av) wrote a fantastic [blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2022/caching-behavior-analysis.html) about caching behavior.
- Using a hands-on approach he highlights some strategies that can be used to understand what is causing a particular process (or processes) to re-run, instead of using the cache from previous runs of the pipeline.
- A great example of a community post that is addressing a common question we see in the Slack channels.
