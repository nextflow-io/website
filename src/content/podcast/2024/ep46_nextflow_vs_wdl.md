Join us to hear Geraldine Van der Auwera chat with Ben Sherman about how Nextflow compares to [WDL](https://openwdl.org/), the Workflow Description Language originally developed at the Broad Institute. After a brief introduction to the history of WDL, Geraldine shares her experience moving to Nextflow, which kicks off a deep dive discussion with Ben about the differences and similarities between the two languages, and Ben shares how he's drawing inspiration from WDL in his quest to further improve Nextflow. <!-- end-archive-description --> We discuss the following technical features:

- Tasks vs. processes: basically the same thing
- Channels: why they're awesome and how to make it easier to leverage their power
- WDL's scatter functions vs. Nextflow's implicit parallelization
- How many operators does Nextflow really need?
- The benefits of a DSL and the appeal of static types
- Don't make me care about what order to pass inputs in
- The evolution of WDL's runtime block vs Nextflow's config files
- Portability across infrastructure backends: who wore it better?
- Cloud-native vs. HPC-to-cloud
