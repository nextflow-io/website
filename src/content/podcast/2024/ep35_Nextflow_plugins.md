Ever wondered about how Nextflow plugins work?
Join us for this walk through tutorial, as
[Ben Sherman](https://github.com/bentsherman/) guides
[Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels/) to create and publish a plugin from scratch.
Right from the first line of code to creating a release and publishing the plugin.

Nextflow plugins have been getting more attention lately and we've been getting a lot of questions in the community.
There is better documentation and resources planned,
but in the mean time we hope that this can be a useful guide for anyone curious in how they work, and interested in getting started.

**This podcast episode is quite different to normal.**
Rather than an interview or a discussion, it's more of a tutorial.
It'll work best if you follow the video, though hopefully it's still useful with just sound.

We'd love to hear what you think of it!
After this we will be back to our usual routine in the podcast,
but we'd love to hear what you thought of this taster!
