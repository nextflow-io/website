In this episode of the podcast, [Geraldine Van der Auwera](https://twitter.com/VdaGeraldine) and [Ben Sherman](https://github.com/bentsherman) talk about the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://ga4gh.org/) and its efforts to develop interoperability standards for pipelining infrastructure.

If the words TES, WES, TRS and DRS are just as much alphabet soup to you, tune in to learn all about how organizations around the world are collaborating to streamline the process of sharing and analyzing data at scale.
