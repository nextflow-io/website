[As recently announced](https://twitter.com/nextflowio/status/1534903352810676224), we are super excited to host a new Nextflow community event late this year! The Nextflow Summit will take place **October 12-14, 2022** at the iconic Torre Glòries in Barcelona, with an associated [nf-core hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-october-2022) beforehand.

### Call for abstracts

Today we’re excited to open the call for abstracts! We’re looking for talks and posters about anything and everything happening in the Nextflow world. Specifically, we’re aiming to shape the program into four key areas:

* Nextflow: central tool / language / plugins
* Community: pipelines / applications / use cases
* Ecosystem: infrastructure / environments
* Software: containers / tool packaging

Speaking at the summit will primarily be in-person, but we welcome posters from remote attendees. Posters will be submitted digitally and available online during and after the event. Talks will be streamed live and be available after the event.
