In a recent publication we assessed the impact of Docker containers technology
on the performance of bioinformatic tools and data analysis workflows.

We benchmarked three different data analyses: a RNA sequence pipeline for gene expression,
a consensus assembly and variant calling pipeline, and finally a pipeline for the detection
and mapping of long non-coding RNAs.

We found that Docker containers have only a minor impact on the performance
of common genomic data analysis, which is negligible when the executed tasks are demanding
in terms of computational time.
