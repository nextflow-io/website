Nextflow ambassadors are passionate individuals within the Nextflow community who play a more active role in fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and engagement. We launched this program at the Nextflow Summit in Barcelona last year, and it's been a great experience so far, so we've been recruiting more volunteers to expand the program. We’re going to close applications in June with the goal of having new Ambassadors start in July, so if you’re interested in becoming an Ambassador, now is your chance to apply!

The program has been off to a great start, bringing together a diverse group of 46 passionate individuals from around the globe. Our ambassadors have done a great job in their dedication to spreading the word about Nextflow, contributing significantly to the community in numerous ways, including writing insightful content, organizing impactful events, conducting training sessions, leading hackathons, and even contributing to the codebase. Their efforts have not only enhanced the Nextflow ecosystem but have also fostered a stronger, more interconnected global community.

To support their endeavors, we provide our ambassadors with exclusive swag, essential assets to facilitate their work and funding to attend events where they can promote Nextflow. With the end of the first semester fast approaching, we are excited to officially announce the second cohort of the Nextflow Ambassador program will start in July. If you are passionate about Nextflow and eager to make a meaningful impact, we invite you to [apply](http://seqera.typeform.com/ambassadors/) and join our vibrant community of ambassadors.

**Application Details:**

- **Call for Applications:** Open until June 14 (23h59 any timezone)
