Nextflow is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that runs in the terminal. Everyone who has launched Nextflow from the command line knows what it‚Äôs like to follow the console output as a pipeline runs: the excitement of watching jobs zipping off as they‚Äôre submitted, the satisfaction of the phrase _‚ÄúPipeline completed successfully!‚Äù_ and occasionally, the sinking feeling of seeing an error message.

Because the CLI is the primary way that people interact with Nextflow, a little bit of polish can have a big effect. In this article, I‚Äôm excited to describe an upgrade for the console output that should make monitoring workflow progress just a little easier.

The new functionality is available in `24.02-0-edge` and will be included in the next `24.04.0` stable release. You can try it out now by updating Nextflow as follows:

```bash
NXF_EDGE=1 nextflow self-update
```

## Background

The Nextflow console output hasn‚Äôt changed much over the 10 years that it‚Äôs been around. The biggest update happened in 2018 when ‚ÄúANSI logging‚Äù was released in version `18.10.0`. This replaced the stream of log messages announcing each task submission with a view that updates dynamically, giving an overview of each process. This gives an overview of the pipeline‚Äôs progress rather than being swamped with thousands of individual task submissions.

I can be a little obsessive tool user interfaces. The nf-core template, as well as MultiQC and nf-core/tools all have coloured terminal output, mostly using the excellent [textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich). I‚Äôve also written a couple of general-use tools around this such as [ewels/rich-click](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/) for Python CLI help texts, and [ewels/rich-codex](https://github.com/ewels/rich-codex) to auto-generate screenshots from code / commands in markdown. The problem with being surrounded by so much colored CLI output is that any tools _without_ colors start to stand out. Dropping hints to the Nextflow team didn‚Äôt work, so eventually I whipped up [a proposal](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/3976) of what the console output could look like using the tools I knew: Python and Rich. Paolo knows me well and [offered up a bait](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/3976#issuecomment-1568071479) that I couldn‚Äôt resist: _‚ÄúPhil. I think this a great opportunity to improve your Groovy skills üòÜ‚Äù._

## Showing what‚Äôs important

The console output shown by Nextflow describes a range of information. Much of it aligns in vertical columns, but not all. There‚Äôs also a variety of fields, some of which are more important than others to see at a glance.

<figure>

</figure>

With some judicious use of the `dim` style, we can make less important information fade into the background. For example, the ‚Äústem‚Äù of the fully qualified process identifiers now step back to allow the process name to stand out. Secondary information such as the number of tasks that were cached, or the executor that is being submitted to, are still there to see but take a back seat. Doing the reverse with some `bold` text helps to highlight the run name ‚Äì key information for identifying and resuming pipeline runs. Using color allows different fields to be easily distinguished, such as process labels and task hashes. Greens, blues and reds in the task statuses allow a reader to get an impression of the run progress without needing to read every number.

Probably the most difficult aspect technically was the `NEXTFLOW` header line. I knew I wanted to use the ‚ÄúNextflow green‚Äù here, or as close to it as possible. But colors in the terminal are tricky. What the ANSI standard defines as `green`, `black` and `blue` can vary significantly across different systems and terminal themes. Some people use a light-color scheme and others run in dark mode. This hadn‚Äôt mattered much for most of the colors up until this point, I could use the [Jansi](https://github.com/fusesource/jansi) library to use named colors and they should look ok. But for the specific RGB of the _Nextflow Green_ I had to [hardcode specific ANSI control characters](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/blob/c9c7032c2e34132cf721ffabfea09d893adf3761/modules/nextflow/src/main/groovy/nextflow/cli/CmdRun.groovy#L379-L389). But it got worse - it turns out that the default Terminal app that ships with OS X only supports 256 colors, so I had to find the closest match (_‚Äúlight sea green‚Äù_ if you‚Äôre curious). Even once the green was ok, using `black` as the text color meant that it would actually render as white with some terminal color themes and be unreadable. In the end, the header text is a very dark gray.

## More than just colors

Whilst the original intent was focused on using color, it didn‚Äôt take long to come up with a shortlist of other niggles that I wanted to fix. I took this project as an opportunity to address a few of these, specifically:

- Make the most of the available width in the terminal
  - Redundant text is now cut down when the screen is narrow. Specifically the repeated `process >` text, plus other small gains such as replacing the three `...` characters with a single `‚Ä¶` character. The percentage-complete is removed if the window is really narrow. These changes happen dynamically every time the screen refreshes, so should update if you resize the terminal window.
- Be more selective about which part of process names are truncated
  - There‚Äôs only so much width that can be saved, and fully qualified process names are long. The current Nextflow console output truncates the end of the identifier if there‚Äôs no space, but this is the part that varies most between pipeline steps. Instead, we can truncate the start and preserve the process name and label.
- Don‚Äôt show all pending processes without tasks
  - The existing ANSI logging shows _all_ processes in the pipeline, even those that haven‚Äôt had any tasks submitted. If a pipeline has a lot of processes this can push the running processes out of view.
  - Nextflow now tracks the number of available rows in the terminal and hides pending processes once we run out of space. Running processes are always printed.

The end result is console output that makes the most of the available space in your terminal window:

## Contributing to Nextflow

Despite building tools that use Nextflow for many years, I‚Äôve spent relatively little time venturing into the main codebase myself. Just as with any contributor, part of the challenge was figuring out how to build Nextflow, how to navigate its code structure and how to write tests. I found it quite a fun experience, so I described and demoed the process in a recent nf-core Bytesize talk titled ‚Äú[Contributing to Nextflow](https://nf-co.re/events/2024/bytesize_nextflow_dev)‚Äù. You can watch the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0fqk5OS-nw), where I explain the mechanics of forking Nextflow, enhancing, compiling, and testing changes locally, and contributing enhancements back to the main code base.

## But wait, there‚Äôs more!

I‚Äôm happy with how the new console output looks, and it seems to have been well received so far. But once the warm glow of the newly merged pull-request started to subside, I realized that there was more to do. The console output is great for monitoring a running pipeline, but I spend most of my time these days digging through much more verbose `.nextflow.log` files. Suddenly it seemed a little unfair that these didn‚Äôt also benefit from a similar treatment.

This project was a little different because the logs are just files on the disk, meaning that I could approach the problem with whatever code stack I liked. Coincidentally, [Will McGugan](https://github.com/willmcgugan) (author of [textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)) was recently [writing about](https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2024/02/11/file-magic-with-the-python-standard-library/) a side project of his own: [Toolong](https://github.com/textualize/toolong). This is a terminal app built using [Textual](https://www.textualize.io/) which is specifically aimed at viewing large log files. I took it for a spin and it did a great job with Nextflow log files right out of the box, but I figured that I could take it further. At its core, Toolong uses the [Rich](https://github.com/textualize/rich) library to format text and so with a little hacking, I was able to introduce a handful of custom formatters for the Nextflow logs. And voila, we have colored console output for log files too!

</figure>

By using Toolong as a viewer we get much more than just syntax highlighting too - it provides powerful file navigation and search functionality. It also supports tailing files in real time, so you can launch a pipeline in one window and tail the log in another to have the best of both worlds!

This work with Toolong is still in two [open](https://github.com/Textualize/toolong/pull/47) [pull-requests](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2895) as I write this, but hopefully you‚Äôll soon be able to use the `nf-core log` command in a directory where you‚Äôve run Nextflow, and it‚Äôll launch Toolong with any log files it finds.
