As a Nextflow Ambassador and a PhD student working in bioinformatics, I’ve always believed in the power of collaboration. Over the past six months, I’ve had the privilege of working with another PhD student specializing in metagenomics environmental science. This collaboration began through a simple email after the other researcher discovered my contact information on the ambassadors’ list page. It has been a journey of learning, problem-solving, and mutual growth. I’d like to share some reflections on this experience, highlighting both the challenges and the rewards.

## Connecting Across Disciplines

Our partnership began with a simple question about running one of nf-core’s metagenomics analysis pipelines. Despite being in different parts of Europe and coming from different academic backgrounds, we quickly found common ground. The combination of our expertise – my focus on bioinformatics workflows and their deep knowledge of microbial ecosystems – created a synergy that enriched our work.

## Navigating Challenges Together

Like any collaboration, ours was not without its difficulties. We faced numerous technical challenges, from optimizing computational resources to troubleshooting pipeline errors. There were moments of frustration when things didn’t work as expected. However, each challenge was an opportunity to learn and grow. Working through these challenges together made them much more manageable and even enjoyable at times. We focused on mastering Nextflow in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment, managing large datasets, and conducting comprehensive data analysis. Additionally, we explored effective data visualization techniques to better interpret and present the findings.
We leaned heavily on the Nextflow and nf-core community for support. The extensive documentation and guides were invaluable, and the different Slack channels provided real-time problem-solving assistance. Having the possibility of contacting the main developers of the pipeline that was troubling was a great resource that we are fortunate to have. The community’s willingness to share and offer help was a constant source of encouragement, making us feel supported every step of the way.

## Learning and Growing

Over the past six months, we’ve both learned a tremendous amount. The other PhD student became more adept at using and understanding Nextflow, particularly when running the nf-core/ampliseq pipeline, managing files, and handling high-performance computing (HPC) environments. I, on the other hand, gained a deeper understanding of environmental microbiomes and the specific needs of metagenomics research.
Our sessions were highly collaborative, allowing us to share knowledge and insights freely. It was reassuring to know that we weren’t alone in our journey and that there was a whole community of researchers ready to share their wisdom and experiences. These interactions made our learning process more rewarding.

## Achieving Synergy

One of the most rewarding aspects of this collaboration has been the synergy between our different backgrounds. Our combined expertise enabled us to efficiently analyze a high volume of metagenomics samples. The journey does not stop here, of course. Now that they have their samples processed, it comes the time to interpret the data, one of my favorite parts. Our work together highlighted the potential for Nextflow and the nf-core community to facilitate research across diverse fields. The collaboration has been a testament to the idea that when individuals from different disciplines come together, they can achieve more than they could alone.
This collaboration is poised to result in significant academic contributions. The other PhD student is preparing to publish a paper with the findings enabled by the use of the nf-core/ampliseq pipeline, which will be a key component of their thesis. This paper is going to serve as an excellent example of using Nextflow and nf-core pipelines in the field of metagenomics environmental science.

## Reflecting on the Journey

As I reflect on these six months, I’m struck by the power of this community in fostering such collaborations. The support network, comprehensive resources, and culture of knowledge sharing have been essential in our success. This experience has reinforced my belief in the importance of open-source bioinformatics and data science communities for professional development and scientific advancement. Through it all, having a collaborator who understood the struggles and celebrated the successes with me made the journey all the more rewarding.
Moving forward, I’m excited about the potential for more such collaborations. The past six months have been a journey of discovery and growth, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with such a dedicated and talented researcher. Our work is far from over, and I look forward to continuing this journey, learning more, and contributing to the field of environmental science.
