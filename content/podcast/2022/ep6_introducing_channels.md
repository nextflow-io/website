#### The News and Views podcast format

- We will record "Seasons" of around six 20-25 min episodes.
- Rob's interviews (previously called _nf-cast_) will continue and will also be released every 1-2 months.
- We're hoping to live-stream and incorporate live comments in the next season (March 2023).

#### Nextflow for astronomers

- Exciting new application of Nextflow.
- An example of Nextflow being used outside of traditional bioinformatics.
- New [Nextflow training aimed at astronomers](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/Pipeline_Training_with_Nextflow/) with an [example pulsar search pipeline](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/Pipeline_Training_with_Nextflow/04-AstronomyWorkflowExample/index.html).
- Check `#astronomy` on nf-core Slack for more details.

#### New initiatives in Asia-Pacific

- Chris recently attended [AMSI](https://bis.amsi.org.au/), [COMBINED](https://www.combine.org.au/symp/combine-symposium-2022/), [ABACBS](https://www.abacbs.org/conference2022), and [SBEI](https://www.abacbs.org/conference2022) in Melbourne Australia.
- Met with a lot of community members and some of the [BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) team.
- Really excited to start work on new initiatives in the Asia-Pacific (watch this space!).

#### nf-core/tools 2.7 release

- A release of [nf-core/tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) 2.7 is underway.
- New features include:
    - New nf-core subworkflows subcommand for creating, removing, testing, updating, and finding subworkflows. More info [here](https://nf-co.re/tools/#subworkflows).
    - Every pipeline has now its own GitHub codespace template, which can be used to develop the pipeline directly in the browser.
    - Improved handling of modules and subworkflows from other repos than nf-core/modules.
    - Pre-commit is now installed as a dependency, which allows us, besides other things, to automatically run prettier to properly format auto-generated JSON / YAML  on the fly even if Prettier has not already been manually installed locally.
    - Shell completion for nf-core commands. More information [here](https://nf-co.re/tools/#shell-completion).
