Software containers using Docker / Singularity are a core part of modern data science, found at the heart of Nextflow pipelines. On today's show, we bring on the creator of Nextflow – [Paolo Di Tommaso](https://twitter.com/PaoloDiTommaso) – to tell us the good, the bad and the ugly of containers.

He talks about "Wave", one of the newest tools to come out of Seqera and how this can make Nextflow pipelines scale on the cloud, work behind closed doors in protected environments and how it can build & augment images with additional requirements on the fly. And all this whilst reducing the amount of boilerplate code required within your pipeline.

As if that wasn't enough, we get a live demo of Wavelit - the open source command-line interface tool, that allows you to leverage the full power of Wave as a stand-alone tool, outside of Nextflow.

You can find out more about Wave at the following links:

- [Seqera product page](https://seqera.io/wave/)
- [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html), describing how to use Wave with Nextflow
- [Wave showcase](https://github.com/seqeralabs/wave-showcase), with examples of configuration and different use cases
- [Wavelit on GitHub](https://github.com/seqeralabs/wavelit), the CLI tool for working with Wave outside of Nextflow
