In a special edition of the Channels Podcast, Phil Ewels chats to Geraldine Van der Auwera! Recorded in-person at the Nextflow Summit Barcelona, we hear a bit about Geraldineâ€™s background - her work at the Broad with GATK and WDL, and the path that brought her to Seqera and the Nextflow community.

You may recognise her name due to a [blog post in October](https://nextflow.io/blog/2023/geraldine-van-der-auwera-joins-seqera.html)
announcing that she would be joining Seqera.
Well, her first day was the first day of the Nextflow Summit and nf-core hackathon!
We thought we'd grab the opportunity to speak to her in person.

Tune in to hear a bit about Geraldine's back-story. We go over her scientific background,
how she got into bioinformatics, her work at the Broad with GATK and WDL, and what
led her to join Seqera to work with the Nextflow and nf-core communities.
