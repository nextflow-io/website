Today in the Channels podcast, we're talking about computing resources...
Ben Sherman takes us through new and upcoming runtime improvements in the Nextflow, leading to better performance fine tuning and simpler syntax for pipelines.

<!-- end-archive-description -->

We cover:

- Fractional CPU requests ([PR #2516](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/pull/2516))
- `resourceLimits` directive (to replace `check_max`) ([PR #2911](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/pull/2911))
- Virtual threads in Groovy ([PR #3871](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/pull/3871))
- WebAssembly runtime (a lightweight alternative to containers)

We mentioned a new blog post at the end, entitled
["Automating pipeline execution with Nextflow and Tower"](https://seqera.io/blog/automating-workflows-with-nextflow-and-tower/).
