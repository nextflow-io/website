We cover:

- Community growth (with stats and graphs!)
- The evolution of nf-core governance
- The latest crop of nf-core pipelines that saw their first release this year and the expansion into domains beyond genomics (even beyond biology!)
- Infrastructure updates including subworkflows and testing with nf-test
- Community updates including [mentorships](https://nextflow.io/blog/2023/czi-mentorship-round-3.html) and training
- Upcoming events in 2024: nf-core online hackathon in March, Boston Summit in May and Barcelona Summit in October. Look out for definitive announcements early next year.

After today’s episode, we’ll be going on break for the winter holiday and will return in January 2024 with a fun mix of topics. Stay tuned!
