Last time we were on a podcast together (Episode 27), we talked a lot about whatâ€™s been happening in the nf-core community, mostly, so in this episode we talk about how Nextflow itself has been evolving.
We go over some highlights from 2023 and then talk a bit about whatâ€™s coming next.

- 2023
    - Fusion support on Azure Batch, Google Batch, SLURM, LSF
        - Discussed in [Podcast Episode 14](https://nextflow.io/podcast/2023/ep14_summer_podcast_release_highlights.html)
    - Spack integration

    - Markdown docs, developer docs
        - Mentioned in [Episode 14](https://nextflow.io/podcast/2023/ep14_summer_podcast_release_highlights.html)
        - Didn't mention in the recording, but there are [new docs](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/developer/index.html) aimed at people wanting to develop Nextflow code too ðŸŽ‰
    - New `nextflow inspect` command
        - See [Nextflow docs](https://nextflow.io/docs/edge/cli.html#inspect)

    - AWS Fargate for compute tasks
        - **Phil got this wrong in the recording**. The head-node-only support in Seqera Platform did come in 2023 (see [blog post](https://seqera.io/blog/seqera-and-aws-fargate/)), but AWS Fargate support for _compute jobs_ did manage to sneak in to the `23.12.0` edge realease, just before Christmas.
