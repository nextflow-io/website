<h2 class="h3">Why become a Nextflow Ambassador?</h2>

<p>The Nextflow ambassador program is a unique and exciting initiative designed to empower passionate individuals within the Nextflow community to play a more active role in fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and engagement. As a Nextflow Ambassador, you will have the opportunity to amplify the reach and impact of Nextflow by promoting its adoption, organizing community events, sharing your expertise through presentations and tutorials, and assisting fellow community members with their questions and challenges. This program is a way to recognise the dedicated volunteers that contribute their time, enthusiasm, and expertise to help grow and strengthen the Nextflow ecosystem. By becoming a Nextflow Ambassador, you'll not only enhance your own skills and network but also contribute to the advancement of scientific research and data analysis on a global scale.</p>
