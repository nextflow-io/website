~~~~~~

The ability to resume an analysis (i.e. caching) is one of the core strengths of Nextflow. When developing pipelines, this allows us to avoid re-running unchanged processes by simply appending `-resume` to the `nextflow run` command. Sometimes, tasks may be repeated for reasons that are unclear. In these cases it can help to look into the caching mechanism, to understand why a specific process was re-run.

We have previously written about Nextflow's [resume functionality](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html) as well as some [troubleshooting strategies](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/troubleshooting-nextflow-resume.html) to gain more insights on the caching behavior. 

In this blog post, we will take a more hands-on approach and highlight some strategies which we can use to understand what is causing a particular process (or processes) to re-run, instead of using the cache from previous runs of the pipeline. To demonstrate the process, we will introduce a minor change into one of the process definitions in the the [nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf) pipeline and investigate how it affects the overall caching behavior when compared to the initial execution of the pipeline.


### Local setup for the test

First, we clone the [nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf
) pipeline locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf
$ cd rnaseq-nf
```

In the examples below, we have used Nextflow `v22.10.0`, Docker `v20.10.8` and `Java v17 LTS` on MacOS.


### Pipeline flowchart

The flowchart below can help in understanding the design of the pipeline and the dependencies between the various tasks.

### Logs from initial (fresh) run

To have something to compare to, we first need to generate the initial hashes for the unchanged processes in the pipeline. We save these in a file called `fresh_run.log` and use them later on as "ground-truth" for the analysis. In order to save the process hashes we use the `-dump-hashes` flag, which prints them to the log.

**TIP:** We rely upon the [`-log` option](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#execution-logs) in the `nextflow` command line interface to be able to supply a custom log file name instead of the default `.nextflow.log`.

```console
$ nextflow -log fresh_run.log run ./main.nf -profile docker -dump-hashes

```

### Edit the `FastQC` process

After the initial run of the pipeline, we introduce a change in the `fastqc.nf` module, hard coding the number of threads which should be used to run the `FASTQC` process via Nextflow's [`cpus` directive](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cpus).

Here's the output of `git diff` on the contents of `modules/fastqc/main.nf` file:

 }
```

### Logs from the follow up run

Next, we run the pipeline again with the `-resume` option, which instructs Nextflow to rely upon the cached results from the previous run and only run the parts of the pipeline which have changed. As before, we instruct Nextflow to dump the process hashes, this time in a file called `resumed_run.log`.

```console
$ nextflow -log resumed_run.log run ./main.nf -profile docker -dump-hashes -resume

## Analysis of cache hashes

From the summary of the command line output above, we can see that the `RNASEQ:FASTQC (FASTQC on ggal_gut)` and `MULTIQC` processes were re-run while the others were cached. To understand why, we can examine the hashes generated by the processes from the logs of the `fresh_run` and `resumed_run`.

For the analysis, we need to keep in mind that:

1. The time-stamps are expected to differ and can be safely ignored to narrow down the `grep` pattern to the Nextflow `TaskProcessor` class.

2. The _order_ of the log entries isn't fixed, due to the nature of the underlying parallel computation dataflow model used by Nextflow. For example, in our example below, `FASTQC` ran first in `fresh_run.log` but wasn’t the first logged process in `resumed_run.log`

### Find the process level hashes

We can use standard Unix tools like `grep`, `cut` and `sort` to address these points and filter out the relevant information:

1. Use `grep` to isolate log entries with `cache hash` string 
2. Remove the prefix time-stamps using `cut -d ‘-’ -f 3` 
3. Remove the caching mode related information using `cut -d ';' -f 1`
4. Sort the lines based on process names using `sort` to have a standard order before comparison
5. Use `tee` to print the resultant strings to the terminal and simultaneously save to a file 

Now, let’s apply these transformations to the `fresh_run.log` as well as `resumed_run.log` entries.

- `fresh_run.log`

```console
$ cat ./fresh_run.log | grep 'INFO.*TaskProcessor.*cache hash' | cut -d '-' -f 3 | cut -d ';' -f 1 | sort | tee  ./fresh_run.tasks.log

 [MULTIQC] cache hash: 167d7b39f7efdfc49b6ff773f081daef

 [RNASEQ:QUANT (ggal_gut)] cache hash: d8b88e3979ff9fe4bf64b4e1bfaf4038
```

- `resumed_run.log`

```console
$ cat ./resumed_run.log | grep 'INFO.*TaskProcessor.*cache hash' | cut -d '-' -f 3 | cut -d ';' -f 1 | sort | tee  ./resumed_run.tasks.log

 [MULTIQC] cache hash: d3f200c56cf00b223282f12f06ae8586
 [RNASEQ:FASTQC (FASTQC on ggal_gut)] cache hash: 92478eeb3b0ff210ebe5a4f3d99aed2d

 [RNASEQ:QUANT (ggal_gut)] cache hash: d8b88e3979ff9fe4bf64b4e1bfaf4038
```

### Inference from process top-level hashes

Computing a hash is a multi-step process and various factors contribute to it such as the inputs of the process, platform, time-stamps of the input files and more ( as explained in [Demystifying Nextflow resume]( https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html)  blog post) . The change we made in the task level CPUs directive and script section of the `FASTQC` process triggered a re-computation of hashes:


```diff

  [RNASEQ:QUANT (ggal_gut)] cache hash: 169ced0fc4b047eaf91cd31620b22540


```

Even though we only introduced changes in `FASTQC`, the `MULTIQC` process was re-run since it relies upon the output of the `FASTQC` process. Any task that has its cache hash invalidated triggers a rerun of all downstream steps:

When we isolate and compare the log entries for `FASTQC` between `fresh_run.log` and `resumed_run.log`, we see the following diff:

```diff

```

Observations from the diff:
1. We can see that the content of the script has changed, highlighting the new `$task.cpus` part of the command.
2. There is a new entry in the `resumed_run.log` showing that the content of the process level directive `cpus` has been added.

In other words, the diff from log files is confirming our edits.

### Understanding why `MULTIQC` was re-run

Here, the highlighted diffs show changing work directory input file paths changing as a result of `FASTQC` being re-run, therefore `MULTIQC` has a new hash and has to be re-run as well.

## Conclusion

Debugging the caching behavior of a pipeline can be tricky, however a systematic analysis can help to uncover what is causing a particular process to be re-run. 

When analyzing large datasets, it may be worth using the `-dump-hashes` option by default for all pipeline runs, avoiding needing to run the pipeline again to obtain the hashes in the log file in case of problems.

Whilst this process works, it is not trivial. We would love to see some community-driven tooling for a better cache-debugging experience for Nextflow, perhaps an `nf-cache` plugin? Stay tuned for an upcoming blog post describing how to extend and add new functionality to Nextflow using plugins.
