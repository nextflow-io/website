[As recently announced](https://twitter.com/nextflowio/status/1534903352810676224), we are super excited to host a new Nextflow community event late this year! The Nextflow Summit will take place **October 12-14, 2022** at the iconic Torre Glòries in Barcelona, with an associated [nf-core hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-october-2022) beforehand.

### Call for abstracts

Today we’re excited to open the call for abstracts! We’re looking for talks and posters about anything and everything happening in the Nextflow world. Specifically, we’re aiming to shape the program into four key areas:

* Nextflow: central tool / language / plugins
* Community: pipelines / applications / use cases
* Ecosystem: infrastructure / environments
* Software: containers / tool packaging

Speaking at the summit will primarily be in-person, but we welcome posters from remote attendees. Posters will be submitted digitally and available online during and after the event. Talks will be streamed live and be available after the event.

### Key dates

Registration for the event will happen separately, with key dates as follows (subject to change):

* Jun 17: Call for abstracts opens
* July 1: Registration opens
* July 22: Call for abstracts closes
* July 29: Accepted speakers notified
* Sept 9: Registration closes
* Oct 10-12: Hackathon
* Oct 12-14: Summit

Abstracts will be read and speakers notified on a rolling basis, so apply soon!

The Nextflow Summit will start Weds, Oct 12, 5:00 PM CEST and close Fri, Oct 14, 1:00 PM CEST.

### Travel bursaries

Thanks to funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative [EOSS Diversity & Inclusion grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core/), we are offering 5 bursaries for travel and accommodation. These will only be available to those who have applied to present a talk or poster and will cover up to $1500 USD, plus registration costs.

If you’re interested, please select this option when filling the abstracts application form and we will be in touch with more details.
