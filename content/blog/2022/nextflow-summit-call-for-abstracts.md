As you may have seen, we recently announced that we will be hosting the **Nextflow Summit 2022** in October! The summit will take place from **12th - 14th October** at the stunning Torre Glòries tower in Barcelona, with an associated [nf-core hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-october-2022) beforehand.

## Call for abstracts

Today we’re excited to open the call for abstracts! We’re looking for talks and posters about anything and everything happening in the Nextflow world. Specifically, we’re aiming to shape the program into four key areas:

* Nextflow: central tool / language / plugins
* Community: pipelines / applications / use cases
* Ecosystem: infrastructure / environments
* Software: containers / tool packaging

Speaking at the summit will primarily be in-person, but we welcome posters from remote attendees. Posters will be submitted digitally and available online during and after the event. Talks will be streamed live and be available after the event.

## Key dates

Registration for the event will happen separately, with key dates as follows (subject to change):

* June 17th: Call for abstracts opens
* July 1st: Registration opens
* July 15th: Call for abstracts closes
* July 29th: Accepted speakers notified
* Sept 9th: Registration closes
* Oct 10th - 12th Hackathon
* Oct 12th - 14th Summit

Nextflow Summit will start at 5pm CEST Wednesday October 12th and close at 1pm CEST Friday 14th May

## Travel bursaries

Thanks to funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative [EOSS Diversity & Inclusion grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core/), we are offering 5 bursaries for travel and accommodation. These will only be available to those who have applied to present a talk or poster and will cover up to $1500 USD, plus registration costs.

If you’re interested, please select this option when filling the abstracts application form and we will be in touch with more details.
