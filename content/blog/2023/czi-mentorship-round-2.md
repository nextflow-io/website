</div>

The global Nextflow and nf-core community is thriving with strong engagement in several countries. As we continue to expand and grow, we remain committed to prioritizing inclusivity and actively reaching groups with low representation.

Thanks to the support of our Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Diversity and Inclusion grant, we established an international Nextflow and nf-core mentoring program. With the second round of the mentorship program now complete, we celebrate the success of the most recent cohort of mentors and mentees.

From hundreds of applications, thirteen pairs of mentors and mentees were chosen for the second round of the program. For the past four months, they met regularly to collaborate on Nextflow or nf-core projects. The project scope was left up to the mentees, enabling them to work on any project aligned with their scientific interests and schedules.

Mentor-mentee pairs worked on a range of projects that included learning Nextflow and nf-core fundamentals, setting up Nextflow on their institutional clusters, translating Nextflow training material into other languages, and developing and implementing Nextflow and nf-core pipelines. Impressively, despite many mentees starting the program with very limited knowledge of Nextflow and nf-core, they completed the program with confidence and improved their abilities to develop and implement scalable and reproducible scientific workflows.

Jing joined the program with the goal of learning how to develop advanced Nextflow pipelines for disease surveillance at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention in China. His mentor was Moritz Beber from Denmark.

Together, Jing and Moritz developed a pipeline for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from sewage samples. They also used GitHub and docker containers to make the pipeline more sharable and reproducible. In the future, Jing hopes to use Nextflow Tower to share the pipeline with other institutions.

## Luria Leslie Founou (Mentee) & Sebastian Malkusch (Mentor)

Luria's goal was to accelerate her understanding of Nextflow and apply it to her exploration of the resistome, virulome, mobilome, and phylogeny of bacteria at the Research Centre of Expertise and Biological Diagnostic of Cameroon. Luria was mentored by Sebastian Malkusch, Kolja Becker, and Alex Peltzer from the Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG in Germany.

For their project, Luria and her mentors developed a [pipeline](https://github.com/SMLMS/nfml) for mapping multi-dimensional feature space onto a discrete or continuous response variable by using multivariate models from the field of classical machine learning. Their pipeline will be able to handle classification, regression, and time-to-event models and can be used for model training, validation, and feature selection.

## Sebastian Musundi (Mentee) & Athanasios Baltzis (Mentor)

Sebastian, from Mount Kenya University in Kenya, joined the mentorship program with the goal of using Nextflow pipelines to identify vaccine targets in Apicomplexan parasites. He was mentored by Athanasios Balzis from the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Spain.

With Athanasios’s help, Sebastian learned the fundamentals for developing Nextflow pipelines. During the learning process, they developed a [pipeline](https://github.com/sebymusundi/simple_RNA-seq) for customized RNA sequencing and a [pipeline](https://github.com/sebymusundi/AMR_pipeline) for predicting antimicrobial resistance genes. With his new skills, Sebastian plans to keep using Nextflow on a daily basis and start contributing to nf-core.

Liliane’s goal was to develop and apply Nextflow pipelines for genomic and epidemiological analyses at the Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública Noel Nutels in Brazil. Her mentor was Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas from Seqera Labs in Brazil.

Liliane and Marcel used Nextflow and nf-core to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes and demographic data for public health surveillance. They used the [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) pipeline and made a new Nextflow script for additional analysis and generating graphs.

## Conclusion

As with the first round of the program, the feedback about the second round of the mentorship program was overwhelmingly positive. All mentees found the experience to be highly beneficial and were grateful for the opportunity to participate. 

<blockquote>
    <em>“Having a mentor guide through the entire program was super cool. We worked all the way from the basics of Nextflow and learned a lot about developing and debugging pipelines. Today, I feel more confident than before in using Nextflow on a daily basis.”</em> - Sebastian Musundi (Mentee)
</blockquote>

Similarly, the mentors also found the experience to be highly rewarding.

<blockquote>
    <em>“As a mentor, I really enjoyed participating in the program. Not only did I have the chance to support and work with colleagues from lowly represented regions, but also I learned a lot and improved myself through the mentoring and teaching process.”</em> - Athanasios Baltzis (Mentor)
</blockquote>

Importantly, all program participants expressed their willingness to encourage others to be part of it in the future.

<blockquote>
    <em>“The mentorship allows mentees not only to learn nf-core/Nextflow but also a lot of aspects about open-source reproducible research. With your learning, at the end of the mentorship, you could even contribute back to the nf-core community, which is fantastic! I would tell everyone who is interested in the program to go for it.”</em> - Anabella Trigila (Mentee)
</blockquote>

As the Nextflow and nf-core communities continue to grow, the mentorship program will have long-lasting benefits beyond those that can be immediately measured. Mentees from the program have already become positive role models, contributing new perspectives to the broader community.

<blockquote>
    <em>“I highly recommend this program. Independent if you are new to Nextflow or already have some experience, the possibility of working with amazing people to learn about the Nextflow ecosystem is invaluable. It helped me to improve my work, learn new things, and become confident enough to teach Nextflow to students.”</em> - Juan Ugalde (Mentee)
</blockquote>

We were delighted with the achievements of the mentors and mentees. Applications for the third round are now open! For more information, please visit https://nf-co.re/mentorships.
