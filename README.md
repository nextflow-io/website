# Nextflow web site

[nextflow.io](https://nextflow.io) is a static web site. Pages are generated by using [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders:

```text
/
├── public/
└── src/
    ├── content/
    │   ├── blog/
    │   └── podcast/
    ├── components/
    ├── layouts/
    └── pages/
```

Blog posts and podcast episodes go into `content` as markdown files. Other top-level pages should be named as `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Astro finds all of this content and builds a page. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
